"Drupal Daze is a two-day Drupal conference that was on July 19 and 20, 2008 at the Science Museum of Minnesota put together by TC Open Circuit. We had a great time and learned a lot."

This is an archive of that site.  

## Installation

This is a Drupal 6 site.  This has not been fully worked out.  Due to some hard coding paths and switch from site based config to default, things are a bit messy.  Good luck.

* Database dump (coming soon)
* May be a prefix:  ```$db_prefix = 'd6_dd_';```
